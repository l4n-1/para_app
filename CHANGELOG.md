# 📝 Changelog

## [COMMIT-10/13/2025-Leo]
### Added
- Email verification popup during sign-up. Checks for verification in real-time and directs User to pasahero_home after.
- Settings integration placeholder (Settings->settingspage(scaffold), PHsettings(Widgets), THsettings(Widgets))

### Fixed 
- Removed unnecessary lines of code from login.dart, signup_page2.dart
- Arranged directories to keep workspace clean.

## Known Issues
- Firebase pop up "Blocked due to unusual activity" when false, preventing added verification pop up and redirect to work.
- Tsuperhero_activation.dart.
- Google Sign in.
- Login page appears longer on real devices compared to emulator view — “Create Account” button partially off-screen.
- Google Maps not working on real device (probably devKey missing on my end).
